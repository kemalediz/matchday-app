/**
 * Pipeline #1 — the shipped `/api/whatsapp/analyze` route, whatever is
 * behind it.
 *
 * Builds the case's world with the existing sim harness (`e2e/sim/
 * group.ts`), posts the messages through the REAL `/api/whatsapp/analyze`
 * route, and reads the world back out of the database.
 *
 * =====================================================================
 * THE CLASS NAME IS HISTORICAL. `stub` MODE IS NOT — IT WAS PORTED
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * "current-analyzer" meant the 19,850-token mega-prompt. §10 step 8
 * (2026-09-06) deleted it. The class is deliberately NOT renamed: its
 * name is in `baseline.stub.json`, in every report under `.e2e/corpus/`
 * and in every scoreboard anyone has quoted, and a rename would make
 * those unreadable for a change that alters nothing about what it does.
 * What it does is unchanged and always was the honest description —
 * post to the real route, read the database back.
 *
 * For two days (2026-09-06 → 2026-09-08) this adapter forwarded NOTHING
 * in `stub` mode: each case carried a `CorpusStubVerdict` and there was
 * nothing left that reads a verdict, so all 36 stubbed cases ran against
 * a server that routed nothing, owned nothing and said nothing. Measured
 * then: 10 of 36 "green", most of them expecting nothing to happen and
 * getting it for the wrong reason, and exactly ONE case in the whole
 * sweep — S26 — changed a single database row.
 *
 * WHAT IT FORWARDS NOW sits one layer either side of where the verdict
 * used to be, exactly as the rest of the suite does (`e2e/sim/group.ts`,
 * `e2e/helpers/stub.ts`): per message, what the ROUTER answered
 * (`route`) and what the EXTRACTOR found (`facts`). Both are properties
 * of the message text, checkable by re-reading it. Everything between
 * here and the database — capacity, the interaction contract,
 * authorisation, `tense`, `basis`, `contingent`, the confidence floor,
 * the bench, the batch-final squad post — is the real shipped code
 * deciding for itself, so every ported case PINS a decision where it
 * used to ASSUME one.
 *
 * The eleven cases whose stub used to be `historical` — "the verdict the
 * model ACTUALLY emitted on the day" — had no successor, because there
 * was no router and no extractor on 2026-05-08 and inventing their
 * output would be `README.md`'s rule 1 in reverse. They were split by
 * asking one question per case: was the READING of the message ever in
 * doubt? Where it was not, the facts are a transcription and the case
 * stays in CI; where the reading itself WAS the incident, the case is
 * live-only, asserts the OUTCOME, and says so in its `liveOnlyReason`.
 * Which bucket each went in, and why, is written at the case.
 *
 * THE BORING CLAIM FIELDS ARE FILLED IN HERE, not in the JSONL. A case
 * states the fields it is about (`polarity`, `tense`, `personNamed`, …)
 * and `withFactDefaults` supplies the rest from the same defaults
 * `helpers/stub.ts:claim()` gives the other twenty-one spec files, so
 * the two can never drift into describing different messages. The
 * defaults are listed in `e2e/corpus/README.md` under "Case shape".
 *
 * LIVE mode is unaffected and always was — it never used the seam, and
 * the `stubbed` guard in `run()` is what keeps it that way.
 *
 * HISTORY IS MANDATORY. `group.ts` forwards the "Recent chat history"
 * block the Pi sends on every production call. PR #26 discovered the sim
 * was omitting it, which meant every live-LLM test written before it ran
 * against a prompt production never uses — Amir's bug reproduced only
 * 2/5 WITH history. Every case's `history` is forwarded on every turn,
 * and later turns also see the earlier turns and MatchTime's own replies.
