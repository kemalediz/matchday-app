/**
 * Group-simulator scenario matrix — SQUAD MESSAGING.
 *
 * The Sutton Lads 2026-06-12 failure class: contradictory squad posts,
 * stale counts, missing bench, raw-digit "names", impossible totals and
 * hallucinated bench promotions. Every squad display must match the
 * database, whatever the LLM verdicts claimed.
 *
 * As of §10 step 4 (2026-09-01) it does so by COMPOSITION rather than
 * correction: `composeSquadStateReply` replaces any reply that shows
 * squad state, or claims a move the database does not support, with a
 * post built from the rows. The post-processors these cases were
 * written against — `enforceCanonicalRoster`,
 * `rewriteOverconfidentPromotion` and the two promotion strips — are
 * gone.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PORTED 2026-09-06 (§10 STEP 8) — AND FIVE OF THE SIX CASES LOST THEIR
 * PREMISE ALTOGETHER
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every case here worked the same way: hand the route a stale, wrong or
 * impossible squad claim as `verdict.reply` and assert the truth came
 * out instead. "We're 5/5 — full squad ✅", "Bench is empty", "9 players
 * for Tuesday", "Greg Gale moves up from the bench".
 *
 * NOTHING CAN MAKE THOSE CLAIMS ANY MORE. A reply is composed by
 * `pipeline/compose.ts` from a `SquadState` read out of the database;
 * there is no channel by which a model-authored sentence enters the
 * route. The failure class the file is named for — the Sutton Lads
 * 2026-06-12 contradictory posts — was closed by construction in step 4
 * and its last input was removed in step 8.
 *
 * SO THE FILE IS REBUILT AROUND WHAT IS STILL FALSIFIABLE, which is the
 * other half of every one of those cases and the half that can still go
 * wrong: the batch-final post states the DATABASE's counts, names and
 * bench, it is emitted ONCE per batch however many messages asked, and a
 * raw-digit pushname never appears in it. Those are properties of the
 * composer and the collapse, not of a patcher, and they are asserted
 * against a world the batch itself changed.
 *
 * WHAT IS GONE AND IS NOT COMING BACK: "the stale prose does not
 * survive". There is no prose to survive.
