/**
 * BENCH CAPACITY — a bench may not exist while the squad has room.
 *
 * Drives the REAL analyze pipeline (router + extractor stubbed, so this
 * is deterministic) and asserts the end state the 17:00 roster renders
 * from.
 *
 * The incident this pins (production, 2026-08-31): a 7-a-side match
 * (maxPlayers 14) sat at 10 confirmed with 4 open slots. A third-party
 * offer was misread as the sender's own standing offer, which classified
 * as registerAttendance:"BENCH", and the old write path benched them
 * without ever checking capacity. The roster then posted as
 * "Confirmed (10/14)" followed by "Bench (1): Amir" — the squad
 * contradicting its own header.
 *
 * The rule now: a BENCH row means the squad is FULL, or a human
 * EXPLICITLY asked for the bench. Never "the classifier inferred it".
 *
 * ── PORTED 2026-09-06, §10 STEP 8. THE CASE GOT STRONGER. ────────────
 *
 * It used to feed a verdict that had ALREADY made the wrong call —
 * `registerAttendance: "BENCH"` on a 10/14 squad — and assert that the
 * write path overrode it. There is no verdict any more, and there is no
 * override either: the extractor reports the two facts the text really
 * carries (`contingent: true`, `conditionOn: "squad"`) and
 * `pipeline/engine.ts` computes the status from capacity. So this file
 * no longer proves "a bad decision is corrected downstream"; it proves
 * the decision is made once, in the place that can see the squad. The
 * distinction the file exists for — INFERRED bench vs a human asking for
 * one — is now a field (`polarity: "bench"`) rather than an intent name,
 * which is exactly §9's "becomes a schema field".
