/**
 * §10 STEP 5 — the router gate, through the REAL analyze route.
 *
 * The unit tests prove the partition is monotone. This proves the thing
 * that actually matters: what a `none` route COSTS, and what the floor
 * buys back.
 *
 * Four questions, in the order they matter:
 *
 *   1. With every message routed `none`, does the batch go quiet without
 *      going invisible? (That is the 44x saving, and the row is what
 *      stops it being a disappearance.)
 *   2. With one real IN in a banter batch, does the IN still register?
 *   3. If the router wrongly routes a real IN `none`, what happens —
 *      with the floor off, and with it on? (The regression, measured,
 *      and the seatbelt catching it.)
 *   4. Does gating narrow only what the MODEL sees, or does it also
 *      narrow what the ENGINE'S BATCH RULES see? (Both, since §10 step 8
 *      — measured in the last case rather than assumed.)
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PORTED 2026-09-06, §10 STEP 8. THREE CASES WERE DELETED — READ WHY
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ① "with the gate OFF, the batch reaches the analyzer exactly as it does
 *    today". `ROUTER_GATE_ENABLED` is deleted from `pipeline/gate.ts`,
 *    together with the analyzer its off position reverted to. There is no
 *    gate-off state: `routerIsNeeded()` now takes no arguments and
 *    returns true, because without a route nothing has an owner and
 *    MatchTime says nothing to anybody. `gate.ts`'s own essay is the
 *    argument, `__tests__/gate.test.ts` ("names no predicate for a flag
 *    that was deleted") is the tombstone, and
 *    `attendance-engine.spec.ts`'s first case pins what replaced it —
 *    an unrouted message is OWNED, and writes nothing.
 *
 * ② "the IN safety net still sees a gated message as the author's latest"
 * ③ "…and DOES fire when the gated message came first"
 *
 *    Both drove the Najib IN safety net: `intent: "in"` with
 *    `registerAttendance: null` was forced back to IN, but only on the
 *    author's LAST message in the batch, and `latestIdxByAuthor` was
 *    built from `fresh`. The net is deleted (§10 step 6/8) and so is its
 *    input — a `Claim` has one `polarity` and cannot contradict itself,
 *    so there is nothing for a net to repair. `grep latestIdxByAuthor
 *    src/` returns nothing. The incident itself is still replayable:
 *    `attendance-engine.spec.ts`'s "S6 — an IN at a FULL squad still
 *    writes" and `e2e/corpus/incidents.jsonl`'s
 *    `S6-najib-in-at-full-squad`.
 *
 * The batch-visibility property those two cases ALSO carried — that a
 * gated message still occupies its place in the batch for the rules that
 * scan it — is kept, and is now case 4 below, driven through the
 * banter-drop guard instead of the deleted net.
