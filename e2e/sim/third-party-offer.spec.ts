/**
 * THIRD-PARTY OFFER — the sender is not the subject.
 *
 * The live-LLM half (`third-party-offer-live.spec.ts`) proves the real
 * model does not read "my brother can play if needed" as the SENDER's
 * own standing offer. This file proves the other half, deterministically:
 * that when the pipeline is told the claim is about somebody else, no
 * row is ever written for the person who typed it.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PORTED 2026-09-06 (§10 STEP 8) — AND THE MECHANISM UNDER TEST CHANGED
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHAT IT USED TO BE. `setLlmStub` fed the route the verdict production
 * actually got on Amir's 30/08 23:03 message —
 *
 *     {intent: "conditional_in", registerAttendance: "BENCH",
 *      reasoning: "Standing-offer conditional …"}
 *
 * — a decision that was already wrong, and asserted that a SEATBELT in
 * `analyze/route.ts` (`offerIsAboutSomeoneElse`, a regex over the body)
 * refused to execute it.
 *
 * WHY THAT SEATBELT IS GONE. `route.ts:141` is now its tombstone:
 * *"offerIsAboutSomeoneElse → `subject`, a field rather than an
 * inference"*. The extractor reports WHO each claim is about, one claim
 * at a time; a claim about the sender and a claim about a brother are
 * two different objects, so there is no longer a single message-level
 * decision for a regex to overrule. `interaction-contract.ts` still
 * exports the function and `__tests__/interaction-contract.test.ts`
 * still pins its patterns, but nothing on the write path calls it.
 *
 * WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THIS FILE. The PROPERTY survives and is what every
 * case below still asserts: a message whose claims are about someone
 * else never moves the sender's row. The MECHANISM moved from a
 * post-hoc strip to the shape of the facts, so the cases are expressed
 * as facts.
 *
 * ONE CASE WAS DELETED — "a stray self IN on a third-party-subject
 * message is stripped too". It fed `registerAttendance: "IN"` on a
 * message about a brother and asserted the strip fired anyway. There is
 * no input that produces it now: `registerAttendance` had no subject,
 * which is exactly why a strip was needed; a `Claim` cannot be about the
 * sender and about somebody else at once. Testing it would mean
 * asserting that a deleted guard fires on input nothing can produce.
 * The half of it that is still real — an unnamed third party provisions
 * no ghost member — is `e2e/sim/attendance-engine.spec.ts`'s "an unnamed
 * third party provisions no ghost member — the A5 incident", and the
 * ask it produces is `e2e/sim/guest-name-ask.spec.ts`.
