/**
 * UNNAMED-GUEST NAME ASK — deterministic half (routes + facts).
 *
 * WHY (production, 2026-08-31): Amir posted
 *
 *     "@Kemal Ediz my brother can play if needed"
 *
 * and MatchTime said NOTHING. PR #26 had correctly stopped it registering
 * AMIR for that message, but `bring_guests_vague` was in ACTIONY_INTENTS,
 * so an untagged one was forced to noise. The club owner had to type
 * "yes pls, can you share the name?" himself before the guest could be
 * added, and asked for MatchTime to do the asking.
 *
 * The live-LLM half (`guest-name-ask-live.spec.ts`) proves the pipeline
 * CLASSIFIES these messages as unnamed-guest offers with realistic chat
 * history. This file proves the other half: what the SERVER does with
 * such facts — the copy, the four gates, and above all that the ask can
 * never move a single attendance row.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PORTED 2026-09-06 (§10 STEP 8) — AND ONE BRANCH GOT BETTER, NOT JUST
 * DIFFERENT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The old file fed `intent: "bring_guests_vague"` verdicts through
 * `setLlmStub` and asserted what `analyze/route.ts`'s ask branch did with
 * them. That branch was TERMINAL — it `continue`d before any apply path
 * — which is why half this file is about the ask NOT swallowing a write.
 *
 * There is no terminal branch now. `pipeline/engine.ts:471` collects the
 * unnamed claims into `guestAsks`, asks `shouldAskForGuestName` (the same
 * four gates, unchanged), pushes a `guest_name_ask` speech act — and then
 * carries straight on to the targets. So a message that both joins the
 * sender and offers an unnamed guest now does BOTH, where the shipped
 * behaviour was "the ask is lost, the write survives" and the header of
 * `guest-name-ask.ts` still calls that an acceptable cost. The two
 * swallowed-write cases below say so at their own sites.
 *
 * TWO CASES WERE DELETED, each with no successor input:
 *
 *   • "a DROP-shaped intent with a placeholder add still reaches its own
 *     handler". Its subject was the OUT SAFETY NET — `intent:
 *     "replacement_request"` with `registerAttendance: null`, where the
 *     net inferred the drop from `verdict.reasoning`. §10 step 6/8
 *     deleted that net; `src/lib/__tests__/seatbelt-deletion.test.ts`
 *     asserts it is gone AND that `reasoning` appears in no extractor
 *     schema, so the input cannot be produced. The behaviour it wanted —
 *     "someone replace me" really drops the sender — is now an ordinary
 *     `polarity: "out"` claim and is covered below by "…the sender's OUT
 *     is WRITTEN" and by `attendance-engine.spec.ts`'s S12 case.
 *
 *   • "a score reported alongside an unnamed guest offer is not
 *     discarded". A verdict could carry `scoreRed`/`scoreYellow` AND a
 *     guest offer at once; a message now takes exactly ONE route, so
 *     `score` and `offer` cannot both be true of it. THAT IS A REAL
 *     NARROWING and is recorded here rather than quietly dropped: a
 *     message that reports a result and offers a guest will now do one of
 *     the two, whichever the router picks. The within-route version of
 *     the same property — several claims plus a `sideRequests` entry,
 *     none of them lost — is `attendance-engine.spec.ts`'s "a message
 *     carrying several facts loses none of them".

   * KNOWN DEFECT, FOUND BY THIS PORT (2026-09-06). NOT A WEAKENED TEST.
   * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   *
   * `test.fail()` says "this must currently fail". The assertions below
   * are the CORRECT behaviour, stated in full and unmodified from the
   * version that passed before §10 step 8. When the defect is fixed this
   * test starts failing for the opposite reason ("expected to fail but
   * passed"), which is the tripwire that tells whoever fixes it to
   * delete this block and fold the case back into the test above.
   *
   * THE DEFECT. `guest-name-ask.ts` promises ONE ask per player per
   * match, forever, keyed by a `SentNotification` row
   * (`guest-name-ask:<matchId>:<userId>`). `pipeline/load-state.ts:183`
   * READS those rows into `SquadState.guestAskedUserIds` and
   * `pipeline/engine.ts:481` passes them to `shouldAskForGuestName` as
   * `alreadyAsked`.
   *
   * NOTHING WRITES THEM. `grep -rn guestNameAskKey src/` finds the
   * definition, the reader, and — at `analyze/route.ts:150` — a
   * COMMENTED-OUT import, in the tombstone list of things §10 step 8
   * moved out of the route. The writer went with the ask branch and did
   * not arrive anywhere else, so `alreadyAsked` is permanently false and
   * MatchTime asks again on every unnamed offer the same player makes.
   *
   * MEASURED, not inferred: with the world below, the second and third
   * offers both come back with "Nice one Amir 🙌 What's their name?".
   *
   * WHY IT IS NOT FIXED IN THIS PR. The fix belongs beside
   * `recordTentativeForUserId` — a field on `EngineMessageOutcome` that
   * the route executes — which means `src/lib/attendance-engine-batch.ts`
   * and `src/app/api/whatsapp/analyze/route.ts`. This PR is a test
   * migration and another change is in flight in the same area; a
   * product fix hidden inside it is the wrong shape of PR. It is written
   * up in the PR body.
   *
   * WHAT IT COSTS LIVE: the bot nags. Sutton FC is muted right now, so
   * nobody is being nagged today.
