/**
 * The pasted-roster defect, reproduced DETERMINISTICALLY.
 *
 * PR #35's self-replay sweep ran the current analyzer against itself:
 * same message, same reconstructed world, same model, twice. Three of
 * its four write-level disagreements were one message shape — a pasted
 * numbered roster. The 2026-06-07 batch
 * (`g-ab95248799:2026-06-07T17:35:23.730Z`, triage card in
 * `.e2e/replay/<runId>/triage.md`) came back as:
 *
 *   run A  →  Mo, Nabeel
 *   run B  →  Adam, Amir, Ehtisham Ul Haq, Martin, Mo
 *
 * from the SAME two messages against the SAME 0/14 squad. Neither run
 * wrote the union. A player's place in a squad decided by luck.
 *
 * A live replay costs money and is, by definition, not reproducible on
 * demand. So this spec does the thing the live sweep cannot: it feeds
 * the route BOTH of the model readings that were actually observed, on
 * the identical real input, through the stub seam — and asserts the
 * database ends up in the same place either way. That turns model
 * non-determinism into a deterministic, free, repeatable test.
 *
 * ── PORTED 2026-09-06, §10 STEP 8 ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The two readings were `AnalysisVerdict`s; they are now two sets of
 * EXTRACTOR FACTS, which is the same disagreement one layer down: run A
 * found one third-party claim off the list, run B found four. Nothing
 * about the input, the world or the expected end state changed.
 *
 * The guard did not move either. `reconcilePastedRoster` runs in
 * `analyze/route.ts` BEFORE the engine and
 * `attendance-engine-batch.ts` refuses any message `parsePastedRoster`
 * recognises, so a paste is decided by arithmetic over the list and the
 * roster post, never by whoever read it. That is why both readings land
 * in the same place: neither of them is consulted.
 *
 * Before the clamp it fails: the two runs leave different squads.
 * After it, both leave the squad untouched, because a re-paste is a
 * restatement of a list and not a registration event. Groups that
 * really do maintain their squad by re-pasting have
 * `lib/squad-from-list.ts` behind `featureSquadFromList`, which keeps
 * the previous list and can diff it; this route cannot and must not
 * guess.

 * does not mention, i.e. prose travelling alongside a paste ('here's the
 * list, also adding Kieran'). Kieran now needs one more message, which is
 * §13's stated trade: a missed add is recoverable in one message." The
 * whole message is claimed by `reconcilePastedRoster`, which computes the
 * new lines from the list and the roster post and never consults an
 * extractor at all.
 *

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * FIXED 2026-09-07. This was `test.fail()` — the fourth instance of the
 * "terminal short-circuit skips every guard below" class recorded in
 * MEMORY.md, and the block that documented it is deleted here as its own
 * comment instructed.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. `analyze/route.ts`'s pasted-roster section called
 * `decidePastedRosterRegistration` on every message and, for ANY message
 * it called a roster, did `statsRequestIds.add(...)` — which peels the
 * WHOLE message out of `fresh` before the router ever runs. The sender's
 * own OUT, sitting in the same message as the paste, was never routed,
 * never extracted, never decided and never written. Pat said "can't make
 * it lads, someone take my spot", pasted the list, and stayed down as
 * playing: the squad reads full, the vacated slot is never offered, and
 * the club turns up short.
 *
 * WHAT FIXED IT. The paste branch now owns the LIST, not the MESSAGE. It
 * still does the arithmetic (`reconcilePastedRoster`) and still registers
 * the appended names, but it leaves the message in the batch and defers
 * its own row/reply until after the owners have run. The engine's blanket
 * refusal of the shape (`attendance-engine-batch.ts`) narrowed in the same
 * change: a roster-shaped message may now carry exactly ONE thing, the
 * SENDER'S OWN DROP (`clampPastedRosterFacts`). Everything else the model
 * reads off a list — third-party INs, and the sender's own IN — is still
 * discarded, which is what keeps the two readings below landing in the
 * same place.
 *
 * WHY A DROP AND NOT AN IN. A paste can never REMOVE anyone by
 * arithmetic, so an OUT beside a paste has no other owner; and PR #35
 * measured that an IN read off a list is exactly the non-deterministic
 * write PR #39 existed to stop. §13's asymmetry points the same way: "a
 * missed add is recoverable in one message; a wrong registration on a
 * paid match is not" — and a missed DROP is neither of those, it is the
 * club a player short on the night.
