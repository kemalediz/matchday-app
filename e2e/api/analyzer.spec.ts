/**
 * Apply-path integration tests — /api/whatsapp/analyze.
 *
 * Each test says what the ROUTER answered and what the EXTRACTOR found
 * for a body, POSTs a batch the way the Pi bot does, and asserts the
 * deterministic server-side apply path via direct DB reads. No Anthropic
 * call, no WhatsApp send (BotJobs are just rows).
 *
 * Tests are serial and share cumulative state on the UPCOMING match:
 *   start    4/5 confirmed (admin, collector, player, third) + Ben on bench
 *   T1 IN    Ian "in"             → CONFIRMED (5/5)
 *   T2 IN    Zara "in" while full → BENCH
 *   T3 OUT   Pat drops            → DROPPED + open BenchSlotOffer
 *   T4 BENCH admin demotes Tom (registerFor BENCH) → BENCH, slot freed
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PORTED 2026-09-06 (§10 STEP 8). SIX CASES MOVED SEAM; THREE WERE
 * DELETED EARLIER, AND THIS IS WHERE THEY WENT.
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The verdict seam wrote the file `analyzeBatch` read. `analyzeBatch`,
 * `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `AnalysisVerdict` and `executeVerdict` are all
 * deleted. The six cases that pin a shipped behaviour of the apply path
 * — capacity, the bench-slot offer, a demote that must not open one, the
 * batch-final squad post, the banter-drop guard, the retry dedupe — are
 * ported here to `engineOn({ body: { route, facts } })`, which is the
 * same seam `e2e/sim/attendance-engine.spec.ts` drives.
 *
 * TWO ASSERTION VALUES CHANGED, both for the same reason, and each says
 * so at its own site: a third-party move reacts 👍 rather than 🪑,
 * because `pipeline/engine.ts:reactFor` gives a status react only when
 * the SENDER's own row moved, and the `AnalyzedMessage.handledBy` audit
 * column reads `attendance-engine` rather than `llm` (the WIRE field in
 * the response is still `llm` for every owned message).
 *
 * ── THE THREE THAT WERE DELETED, AND WHERE EACH IS COVERED NOW ───────
 *
 * These three are NOT portable, because the thing they tested is gone
 * rather than moved. Each asserted a SAFETY NET whose only input was a
 * field on `AnalysisVerdict`, and §10 step 6/8 deleted all three nets
 * from `analyze/route.ts`:
 *
 *   1. "bench-demote SAFETY NET: reply claims the move but registerFor
 *      is empty → server still demotes" (Salman Shelly, 2026-06-11,
 *      9afa357). Input: `verdict.reply`, a prose regex.
 *   2. "OUT safety net must NOT fire on a group-level chase" (Kemal,
 *      2026-05-28). Input: `verdict.reasoning`, a prose regex, in the
 *      over-fire direction.
 *   3. "OUT safety net: replacement_request with no registerAttendance
 *      drops the sender" (Mojib/Habib, 2026-05-26, f35dfe6). Same input,
 *      under-fire direction.
 *
 * COVERED NOW BY `src/lib/__tests__/seatbelt-deletion.test.ts`, which
 * inverts rather than retires: it asserts the three markers are ABSENT
 * from the route, that `executeVerdict` and the verdict types are gone,
 * and — the load-bearing half — that each net's input (`intent`,
 * `reasoning`, `reply`) appears in NO owned route's extractor schema, so
 * the error class cannot be reintroduced silently. It also asserts each
 * of the three incident DATES still has a replayable case in
 * `e2e/corpus/incidents.jsonl`, which is what stops "the incident moved"
 * from becoming "the incident was forgotten". The OUT net's own regex
 * logic remains unit-tested against real production reasoning strings in
 * `src/lib/__tests__/out-safety-net.test.ts`.
 *
 * Restating those three here against a verdict would be
 * asserting that a deleted guard still fires on input nothing can
 * produce — a green tick over nothing, which is the shape this codebase
 * hunts rather than writes.

//   • "OUT safety net must NOT fire on a group-level chase"

//   per claim cannot contradict itself, and no schema has a `reasoning`
//   or a `reply` field for a regex to parse.
