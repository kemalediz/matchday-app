/**
 * IS THIS MATCH AT RISK OF BEING CALLED OFF? — pure, no DB, no LLM.
 *
 * Kemal, 2026-09-06: "if the match is close and there are many missing
 * players, the 5pm update should be more encouraging for people to
 * attend and kind of a warning that match will be cancelled if we can't
 * find enough players."
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ARITHMETIC AND NOT A PROMPT
 * ---------------------------------------
 * "Close" and "many missing" are exactly the kind of judgement call that
 * this repo has spent a week taking away from the model. Left to the
 * prompt, the same squad state produces a cancellation warning on one
 * run and not on the next — and a warning that appears in three runs out
 * of six is worse than one that never appears at all, because nobody in
 * the group can tell what it means. Worse in the other direction: a
 * spurious "we might have to call this off" on a healthy fixture is
 * alarming in a real customer's WhatsApp group.
 *
 * Same shape as `format-switch.ts`, and for the same reason (the
 * 2026-08-30 incident, where the model did the subtraction itself and
 * named three real people as benched who weren't): the server computes
 * the answer, the prompt is handed the answer, and the prompt is told in
 * as many words never to do the counting itself.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLDS (approved by Kemal, 2026-09-06)
 * ----------------------------------------------
 *   atRisk = hoursToKickoff <= 48 && need >= 4
 *
 * `need` is the shortfall to `Match.maxPlayers` — the TOTAL across both
 * teams, the same unit `buildMatchContextBlock` prints as "need N more".
 * Never players-per-team. (`format-switch.ts` has the full note on why
 * that distinction has bitten us in production.)
 *
 * Applies to the 17:00 `daily-in-list` chase only. The pre-kickoff kinds
 * already carry their own urgency; doubling it up would read as panic.
