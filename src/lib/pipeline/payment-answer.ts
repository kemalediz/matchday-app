/**
 * WHO HAS NOT PAID — the decision, as a pure function.
 *
 * "@Match Time who hasn't paid" was one of the ten tagged questions
 * MatchTime could not answer. Every other one on that list was a read of
 * something `SquadState` already held; this one is not. It is also the
 * only one where being WRONG costs a person something: telling a group
 * that somebody has not paid when they have is socially expensive and
 * cannot be taken back with a correction ten minutes later.
 *
 * So the truth is defined in ONE place — `buildUnpaidTail`
 * (`bot-scheduler.ts:242-300`), which has been posting this number to
 * the live Sutton FC group since April — and this module is that
 * definition, moved to where a question can reach it and made pure so it
 * can be tested without a database, a match or a model.
 *
 * ── NO PRISMA HERE, AND THAT IS STRUCTURAL ───────────────────────────
 * `compose.ts`'s header records why this directory keeps its I/O in one
 * file: the Playwright worker never loads Prisma, and a static import of
 * `../db` kills the whole corpus spec at load. `load-state.ts` does the
 * one query and hands the rows in. Nothing below reads the world.
 *
 * ── WHICH ORG FLAG GATES IT — AND WHY IT IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE ──────
 * Sutton FC, read live on 2026-09-09:
 *
 *   paymentTrackingEnabled   FALSE
 *   paymentCollectionEnabled TRUE
 *   stripeChargesEnabled     TRUE
 *
 * The flag with "tracking" in its name is off, and MatchTime still knows
 * exactly who has paid: 4 of 10 on 2026-09-08, 7 of 10 on 07-14, 12 of
 * 14 on 07-07, 13 of 14 on 06-30. The three flags do NOT mean what their
 * names suggest, so each is written out here:
 *
 *   • `paymentTrackingEnabled` gates the POLL path and the group chase:
 *     ticking your team in the WhatsApp payment poll writes `paidAt`
 *     (`poll-vote/route.ts:118`), an admin's "Amir paid for 4" becomes a
 *     `PaymentCredit`, and the 17:00 update carries the "N payments
 *     still pending" tail. Sutton turned it OFF on 2026-04-29 because
 *     Elvin, who takes the money, found the chase overhead unnecessary
 *     (the schema comment says so).
 *   • `paymentCollectionEnabled` gates STRIPE per-match fee collection.
 *     When it is on and the fee is set, pay links go out and `paidAt` is
 *     written by the Stripe webhook (`payment-flow.ts:157`) and by the
 *     collector confirming a direct payment
 *     (`actions/payments.ts:327`). This is where Sutton's `paidAt` rows
 *     come from.
 *   • `stripeChargesEnabled` is a fact about the connected ACCOUNT — can
 *     it accept charges and receive payouts. It gates the two Stripe
 *     rails; "pay the collector directly" runs without it. It says
 *     nothing about whether MatchTime knows who paid, so it is not a
 *     gate here at all.
 *
 * The question is therefore not "which flag is on" but "does MatchTime
 * have a source of truth for `paidAt` on THIS match": the poll path
 * (tracking) or released pay links (collection). If neither, the honest
 * answer is that MatchTime does not know — never an empty list, which
 * would read as "everyone has paid".
 *
 * ── AND THE ANSWER NAMES NOBODY ──────────────────────────────────────
 * This module returns COUNTS. It has no field for a name, so no caller
 * can print one, which is the point rather than an omission.
 *
 * The precedent is `buildUnpaidTail` and it is explicit: *"Poll-only
 * format per Sait's suggestion (2026-04-25). No naming, no shaming."*
 * That is the customer's own decision about their own group, and this
 * answer goes to the same place the chase does — `AnswerMessageOutcome`
 * carries a `reply` and a `react`, both of which `route.ts` sends to the
 * GROUP. There is no DM on this path, so "tell the admin instead" is not
 * an option that exists here; the only choice is between a count to the
 * group and nothing.
 *
 * Which is also why there is no ADMIN GATE. The 17:00 scheduler already
 * posts this exact number to the whole group, unprompted, on every org
 * that tracks. Answering a tagged question with the number the group is
 * shown anyway is strictly less than what already happens; refusing to
 * answer an ordinary member would be a silence bought with nothing.
 * Naming names — which nothing here can do — would be the part that
 * needed an admin, and a DM to send it in.
