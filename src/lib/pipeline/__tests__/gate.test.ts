/**
 * THE GATE — §10 step 5, which used to be "router in front, mega-call
 * behind" and is now "router in front, deterministic owners beside".
 *
 * These tests exist to prove ONE property, and everything else here is
 * supporting evidence for it:
 *
 *   THE FLOOR CAN ONLY EVER ADD A MESSAGE TO THE ANALYSED SET.
 *
 * Kemal's objection on 2026-09-01 — "why still string regex??" — was
 * about a regex fast path that CLASSIFIED, decided a message meant
 * "in", and swallowed half of it. That regex is deleted and stays
 * deleted. This one is a different object: it has exactly one output
 * channel, membership of the set of ids that reach an owner at all, and
 * it is monotone on that channel. Its worst case is spending one
 * extractor call on a batch that did not need it. It has no path to
 * losing a write, because it never decides anything about a message it
 * touches — it only ever says "also look at this".
 *
 * §10 STEP 8 CHANGED WHAT IS ON THE FAR END OF THAT CHANNEL AND NOTHING
 * ELSE. `analyzeBatch` is deleted; a message that is not skipped now
 * reaches `attendance-engine-batch.ts`, `pipeline/answer-batch.ts`,
 * `team-ops-engine-batch.ts`, `score-engine-batch.ts` or
 * `admin-ops-engine-batch.ts` instead of the 19,850-token prompt. The
 * monotonicity proof is about the CHANNEL, so every case in it stands
 * untouched — and it matters more than it did, because a message the
 * floor does not rescue is now seen by nobody at all rather than by a
 * second decider.
 *
 * A property has to be PROVEN, not asserted, so:
 *   - `routeFloor` never returns `none` (exhaustive + fuzz), which is
 *     what makes the override monotone at the router;
 *   - `partition` with the floor on is a SUPERSET of `partition` with it
 *     off, over a fuzz of arbitrary routes × bodies;
 *   - the analysed messages are the SAME OBJECTS in the SAME ORDER
 *     either way, so nothing can be "handled differently once
 *     analysed".

//   process that thinks it is a test is a liability with no upside.
//
//   `route-flags.ts`'s `x-mt-engine-routes` header SURVIVES and keeps
//   its own inert-without-MT_TEST_MODE cases, because step 7's routes
//   still have two shipped sides to compare.
