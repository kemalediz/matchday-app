/**
 * §10 STEP 7 — "revert: per-route flag", asserted rather than asserted-in-prose.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DEFAULT INVERTED ON 2026-09-06 (§10 STEP 8), AND THAT IS THE
 * POINT OF MOST OF THIS FILE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Property 1 used to read: "DEFAULT OFF. Step 6's flag test exists
 * because a flag that defaults on is a production change disguised as a
 * refactor." That was right while an unowned route fell back to the
 * 19,850-token mega-prompt, which answered it. Step 8 deletes the
 * mega-prompt. Default-off would now mean MatchTime answers no question,
 * records no score and credits no payment — it would go silent on four
 * of its nine routes and call it a safe default.
 *
 * So the four routes are ON unless a flag EXPLICITLY says otherwise, and
 * the strictness moves with the default: only `0`, `false`, `no` and
 * `off` take a route off the air. A typo in a Vercel env var must not
 * silently stop MatchTime replying, which is the exact mirror of the
 * rule these flags shipped with.
 *
 * The three properties this file proves are otherwise unchanged:
 *
 *   1. DEFAULT ON, AND ONLY AN EXPLICIT OFF SPELLING TURNS A ROUTE OFF.
 *      An unrecognised value leaves the route ON — the direction that
 *      cannot lose a reply.
 *   2. INDEPENDENCE. Four routes need the property pairwise: reverting
 *      the money must not revert the reads. A shared spelling helper
 *      would not give it — a loosened spelling would loosen all of them
 *      at once — so `route-flags.ts` keeps a deliberate copy of
 *      `gate.ts`'s and the two are cross-checked below.
 *   3. A FLAG ONLY EXISTS ONCE IT OWNS ITS ROUTE. Part 1 kept
 *      `SCORE_ENGINE_ENABLED` and `ADMIN_OPS_ENGINE_ENABLED` as reserved
 *      names nothing read; part 2 honours them because
 *      `score-engine-batch.ts` and `admin-ops-engine-batch.ts` exist.
 *      The tests below assert both halves: the reserved SPELLINGS were
 *      the ones adopted, and each flag turns off exactly its own route.
 *
 * WHAT IS NO LONGER ASSERTABLE: step 5's and step 6's flags are deleted
 * (`gate.ts` carries the argument), so "they cannot turn a step-7 route
 * on" is now a statement about two names nothing reads. It is kept as
 * "an unrelated env var changes nothing", which is the surviving half.
