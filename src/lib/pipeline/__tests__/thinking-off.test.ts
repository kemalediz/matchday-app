/**
 * THE EXTRACTORS MUST NOT THINK, AND IT IS NOT A COST ARGUMENT.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * MEASURED ON A REAL MESSAGE, 5 RUNS OF 5, 2026-09-06
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The §10 step 8 dry run (`TEAMS=1`, case T5) put this through the live
 * pipeline against the real Sutton FC squad:
 *
 *   "@Match Time show us the teams again without regenerating
 *    replacing Ehtisham with Najib"
 *
 * and got, 5 times out of 5:
 *
 *   teams extractor failed: the model hit max_tokens (1024) and the
 *   response is cut off. Refusing to parse a truncated body.
 *
 * Raising the cap does not fix it. Probed directly at `max_tokens:
 * 2048` and again at `4096`, the response came back
 * `stop_reason: max_tokens`, `output_tokens: 2048` / `4096`, and
 * **content blocks: `thinking` only. Zero text blocks. Length 0.**
 *
 * `claude-sonnet-5` runs ADAPTIVE THINKING when the `thinking` parameter
 * is omitted. T5 is a self-contradictory instruction — "show the teams
 * again WITHOUT REGENERATING" and "REPLACING Ehtisham with Najib" cannot
 * both be honoured — so the model deliberates, and on a hard enough
 * message it spends the entire budget deliberating and never emits the
 * JSON at all.
 *
 * Three neighbouring phrasings prove it is the ambiguity and not the
 * length: "generate the teams" -> 41 output tokens, text block, clean;
 * "show us the teams again without regenerating" -> 40 tokens, clean;
 * T5 with "without regenerating" removed -> 616 tokens, thinking THEN
 * text, clean. Only the contradictory one runs away.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS IS A STEP 8 BUG EVEN THOUGH THE CONFIG PREDATES STEP 8
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The behaviour is not new — the extractors have been on `sonnet-5`
 * since step 6. What changed is the CONSEQUENCE. Before step 8 a
 * truncated extraction handed the message to the analyzer. Now it means
 * MatchTime says nothing, and on an attendance route it means a player
 * who said IN is not in the squad. Step 8's retry does not save it
 * either: the failure is deterministic, so the second attempt burns the
 * same budget the same way (measured 5/5).
 *
 * The fix is to stop asking for something the extractor was never meant
 * to do. §6.2 is explicit about the job: return "FACTS about the text
 * only… No intent. No `registerAttendance`. No reply. No emoji. No
 * `reasoning` prose." A model deliberating about what SHOULD happen is
 * the mega-prompt's failure mode reappearing one layer down, and
 * `output_config.format` already constrains the answer to a shape that
 * has nowhere to put a deliberation.
