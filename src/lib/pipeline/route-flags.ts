/**
 * §10 STEP 7 — ONE FLAG PER ROUTE.
 *
 *   "Migrate the rest — `question`, `team_ops`, `score`, `admin_ops`,
 *    one per week. Retire the mega-prompt when the last route leaves."
 *    risk: low each.  revert: PER-ROUTE FLAG.
 *
 * Step 5 shipped one flag (`ROUTER_GATE_ENABLED`) and step 6 shipped a
 * second (`ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_ENABLED`) covering three routes at once,
 * because those three are one decision: they all end in an attendance
 * write and share every capacity, authorisation and corroboration rule.
 * The four routes left are NOT one decision. A question is a read, a
 * team post is a different read, a score is a write against a finished
 * match and a payment credit is real money on a live club. Reverting one
 * must not revert the others, so each gets its own switch — which is
 * what §10's revert column asks for, in those words.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE DEFAULT INVERTED ON 2026-09-06 (§10 STEP 8): ALL FOUR ROUTES ARE
 * ON UNLESS A FLAG EXPLICITLY SAYS OTHERWISE
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * What stood here, verbatim, and it was right for as long as there was
 * something behind these flags:
 *
 *   "DEFAULT OFF, AND IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE. Same four spellings as
 *    `gate.ts`, same strictness … so a typo in a Vercel env var can
 *    never turn a route over."
 *
 * Step 8 deletes `analyzeBatch` and the 19,850-token `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
 * The thing an unowned route fell back to is gone, so default-off no
 * longer means "the analyzer handles it" — it means MatchTime answers no
 * question, shows no teams, records no score and credits no payment. It
 * would go silent on four of its nine routes and call that a safe
 * default. So the default flips, and the STRICTNESS FLIPS WITH IT: only
 * `0`, `false`, `no` and `off` take a route off the air, and anything
 * else — a typo, an empty string, an unset variable — leaves it ON.
 * That is the same rule as before, pointed at the same outcome: a
 * mistyped env var must never silently change what MatchTime does.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THESE FOUR ARE KEPT WHEN TWO OTHER FLAGS WERE DELETED
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ROUTER_GATE_ENABLED` and `ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_ENABLED` were deleted in
 * the same change rather than defaulted on (`gate.ts` carries the full
 * argument). The distinction is not stylistic, and it is the one to
 * apply to the next flag anybody proposes:
 *
 *   AN OFF POSITION MUST HAVE AN IMPLEMENTATION.
 *
 *   • These four have one, and it is survivable. If the question engine
 *     starts answering wrongly at 2am, `QUESTION_ENGINE_ENABLED=0` makes
 *     MatchTime go QUIET on questions and `lib/operator-note.ts` DMs an
 *     admin to say a message went unowned. The club loses a convenience
 *     and a human finds out. That is a useful lever at 2am.
 *   • `ATTENDANCE_ENGINE_ENABLED=0` would have left NOBODY handling
 *     `self_att` / `other_att` / `offer` / `unsure` — every "IN", every
 *     "can't make it". A kill switch for the product's core write path
 *     wearing the name of a tuning flag. There is no such flag any more.
 *
 * SAY IT PLAINLY, because a reader in six months will assume otherwise:
 * "OFF" NO LONGER MEANS "THE ANALYZER DECIDES IT". IT MEANS SILENCE IN
 * THE GROUP PLUS AN OPERATOR NOTE. And these flags are per-route tuning,
 * not a revert of step 8 — THE REVERT FOR STEP 8 AS A WHOLE IS
 * `git revert`, not a flag.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ALL FOUR FLAGS EXIST — AND THAT IS A CLAIM, NOT A TIDY-UP
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Part 1 shipped two and RESERVED the other two as constants nothing
 * read, because `gate.ts` states the rule this file obeys: a flag that
 * looks enabled and does nothing is "the worst kind of flag".
 *
 * Part 2 promoted them, and the rule is the reason it may: `score` and
 * `admin_ops` have owners — `score-engine-batch.ts` and
 * `admin-ops-engine-batch.ts`, each with its own apply layer — so
 * `SCORE_ENGINE_ENABLED=0` genuinely takes the route off the air rather
 * than handing it somewhere else. If either owner is ever deleted, its
 * flag must go with it in the same change.
 *
 * `route-flags.test.ts` asserts that each flag turns OFF exactly its own
 * route, that all four are pairwise independent, that an unrecognised
 * value leaves a route ON, and that an unrelated env var changes
 * nothing.

//                  the directory to keep it that way.
//   • `generate` → `team-ops-engine-batch.ts`. A WRITE: it rewrites
//                  every `TeamAssignment`, force-confirms named players,
//                  moves `Match.status` and runs the rating adjuster.
