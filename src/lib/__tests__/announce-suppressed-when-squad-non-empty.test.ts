/**
 * The announcement must never fire over a squad that already exists.
 *
 * The incident (2026-09-06, Sutton FC, live group): at 09:00 MatchTime
 * posted the plain announcement
 *
 *     📅 *Tuesday 7-a-side* — *Tuesday 8 September at 21:30* at Goals
 *     North Cheam.
 *
 *     Say *IN* to join. First 14 confirmed play.
 *
 * for a match that already had SIX confirmed players. The post carries no
 * roster and no count, so to the group it read as though the squad had
 * been wiped and everybody had to sign up again.
 *
 * Nothing about the timing was a bug: the match was created 27 Aug, the
 * `isNextUpcoming` gate correctly held the announcement while the 1 Sept
 * match was still the next fixture, the bot was muted 1–5 Sept, and this
 * was simply the first 09:00–13:00 window with the bot live. Every
 * existing gate behaved correctly — the announcement itself was the wrong
 * message to send over a non-empty squad.
 *
 * Kemal's call: "it shouldn't fire if the squad is non-empty as we already
 * announce at 5pm". So the fix is SUPPRESSION, not rewording — the 17:00
 * daily post already states the fixture with a real roster and a real
 * count once anyone is in.
 *
 * These tests drive the real `computeDuePosts` with Prisma mocked (the
 * `vi.mock("@/lib/db")` pattern used by out-of-band-announce.test.ts), so
 * they exercise the actual gate rather than a copy of it.
