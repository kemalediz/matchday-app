/**
 * §10 STEPS 6 AND 8 — THE SEATBELTS ARE ACTUALLY DELETED NOW.
 *
 *   step 6: "Delete the OUT net, the IN net, the bench-demote net, and
 *            both prose-parsing regexes."
 *
 * Step 6 could not do it. This file's previous version said why, and the
 * reasoning was right at the time:
 *
 *   "they are still physically present, because the flag ships default
 *    OFF and §10's revert for this step is 'flag flips the three routes
 *    back'. A revert that restored the analyzer without its guards is
 *    not a revert. The redundancy proof is real but CONDITIONAL, and the
 *    condition is exactly what this flag controls. They become deletable
 *    the day the flag defaults ON and the old attendance path is retired
 *    with step 7."
 *
 * That day is today. Step 8 deletes `analyzeBatch` and the 19,850-token
 * `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, so there is no analyzer to revert to and no flag
 * controlling the condition. The three nets are gone from
 * `analyze/route.ts`, along with `executeVerdict` and every other branch
 * whose input was a field on `AnalysisVerdict`.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE STILL EXISTS AFTER THE THING IT WATCHED IS GONE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four seatbelts were found dead in this codebase on 2026-08-31, all
 * silent, ALL WITH COMMENTS CLAIMING THEY WORKED. A deletion is not
 * allowed to rest on an essay, and neither is the claim that the error
 * class went with it. So the file inverts rather than retires:
 *
 *   1. GONE — the three markers are absent from the route. Checked, not
 *      asserted in prose, because "we meant to delete it" and "it is
 *      deleted" have been different things here before.
 *   2. STILL UNREPRESENTABLE — each net's only input (`intent`,
 *      `reasoning`, `reply`) is a field no owned route's extractor
 *      schema contains. THIS IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS MOST NOW. While
 *      the nets existed, a schema growing a `reasoning` field back would
 *      only have made a guard reachable. With them gone it would mean
 *      the model is being asked for prose again, with nothing watching
 *      it — so this assertion is the load-bearing one, and it is why the
 *      file was inverted instead of deleted.
 *   3. NOTHING SLIPPED BACK — `executeVerdict` and the verdict types are
 *      absent too, so a future change cannot quietly reintroduce the
 *      shape these guards were written for.
