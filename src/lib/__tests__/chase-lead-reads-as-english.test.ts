/**
 * The lead line of a scheduled chase must read as English.
 *
 * ── the incident (dry run, 2026-09-05, live model, reproduced twice) ──
 *
 *     ☀️ Morning all — we still need 8 players for on Tue 8 Sept
 *     21:30's 7-a-side at Goals North Cheam, kickoff 21:30.
 *
 *     We're 8 short for on Tue 8 Sept 21:30's 7-a-side …
 *
 *     Squad locked in — see you all on Tue 8 Sept 21:30 at 21:30 …
 *
 * "for on Tue 8 Sept 21:30's" is not English, and the kickoff time is
 * printed twice.
 *
 * ── the cause, which is NOT the model ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both artefacts are produced DETERMINISTICALLY by `enforceProximity`,
 * with no model involvement at all. Feed it the perfectly good sentence
 * the model actually wrote — "we still need 8 players for tonight's
 * 7-a-side …" — and it returns the broken one, byte for byte.
 *
 * Two separate faults compound:
 *
 *   1. `kickoffLocal` was built with a single `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
 *      carrying weekday+day+month AND hour+minute, then `.replace(/,/g,
 *      "")`. en-GB renders that as "Tue 8 Sept, 21:30", so stripping the
 *      comma leaves "Tue 8 Sept 21:30" — and the ` at ` the code then
 *      tried to `.split()` on (per its own comment, `Format: "Tue 28 Apr
 *      at 21:30"`) was never there. `split(" at ")[0]` therefore returned
 *      the WHOLE string, so the "day part" carried the kickoff time into
 *      the roster header and into `friendlyDay`.
 *
 *   2. `enforceProximity` substituted `friendlyDay` ("on Tue 8 Sept")
 *      for the bare token "tonight" with no regard for the grammar
 *      around it. "for tonight's 7-a-side" → "for on … 's 7-a-side".
 *
 * Fault 1 alone gives the duplicated time; fault 2 alone gives "for on".
 * Both are fixed here, and both halves are asserted separately so a
 * future regression names which one came back.
 *
 * These are deterministic tests over pure functions — no model, no DB.
 * The live counterpart (all five chase kinds, real model) is
 * `scripts/dryrun-pipeline.ts --chases`.
