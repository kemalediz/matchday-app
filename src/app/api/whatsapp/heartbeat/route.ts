/**
 * THE PI'S SELF-REPORT.
 *
 * The bot POSTs here on every batch-flush tick — roughly every 10
 * minutes per monitored group, INCLUDING the tick where the buffer was
 * empty and there was nothing to analyse.
 *
 * ── Why a dedicated endpoint and not a piggyback ──────────────────────
 *
 * The 2026-08-30 audit suggested sending the counters "with the existing
 * analyze POST", on the stated basis that "the bot already POSTs to
 * /api/whatsapp/analyze every 10 minutes". That is not what the bot does.
 * `flushGroup` returns early on an empty buffer (`smart-analysis.ts`) and
 * never POSTs at all — so the analyze call is conditional on there being
 * messages to send.
 *
 * Which makes the piggyback structurally unable to report the FLAGSHIP
 * failure. In August the inbound handler ran hundreds of times, every
 * message was dropped before the buffer, and every flush therefore found
 * an empty buffer and sent nothing. A counter payload attached to the
 * analyze POST would have been silent for exactly the three days it was
 * needed.
 *
 * The other candidate was `/api/whatsapp/due-posts`, which the Pi polls
 * unconditionally every 30s. Rejected on two grounds: it is a GET, so
 * counters would ride in a query string; and it is the claim-on-dispatch
 * path, the single most dangerous route in this system (the 2026-07-19
 * duplicate-send incident put 30+ copies of one post into a customer's
 * group). Adding a write to it to improve observability would be trading
 * the worst failure we have had for a better view of a lesser one.
 *
 * "A dedicated endpoint is one more thing to break" is a real objection
 * and it has a real answer: the thing that watches this endpoint watches
 * for its ABSENCE. If the heartbeat route breaks, `/api/cron/bot-health`
 * sees no fresh row and alerts. The detector for a broken detector is the
 * absence detector, and it is a separate deployment surface (a Vercel
 * cron plus Resend) from the thing being detected.
 *
 * ── This route can never cost the club a message ──────────────────────
 *
 * It writes one row and returns. It touches no match, no attendance, no
 * outbound queue. On the Pi side `postHeartbeat` swallows every failure,
 * so a 500 here is invisible to message delivery — which is the correct
 * relationship between a monitoring path and the thing it monitors.
