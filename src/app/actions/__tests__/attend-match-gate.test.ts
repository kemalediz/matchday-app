 *

/**
 * ── DEGRADED PARTICIPANT SWEEP (2026-08-31, re-based 2026-09-09) ────────
 *
 * The sweep has been broken since 2026-07-07. When it is stale, a null
 * sighting means "we could not look", not "you are not in the group", and
 * nine real Sutton players were being blocked and told a falsehood.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FRESHNESS CLOCK MOVED OFF `Membership` (2026-09-09) ────────
 *
 * The degraded mode used to key off `MAX(Membership.lastSeenInGroupAt)`
 * across the org, which was sound while the sweep was that column's ONLY
 * writer. Adding inbound group messages as a second writer would have
 * broken it in the most dangerous way available: one chatty player's
 * "haha" refreshes his own sighting, the org's MAX goes fresh, and the
 * gate concludes the sweep is healthy. It is not. Degraded mode would
 * switch itself off for exactly the people it protects — the never-seen
 * member who does NOT post and is only vouched for by a squad row — and
 * they would go back to being told a falsehood, silently, with no banner
 * on the dashboard and no `sweep-stale` alert either.
 *
 * So the two facts are now two columns:
 *   - `Membership.lastSeenInGroupAt` — did we ever see THIS PERSON in the
 *     group. Sweep or their own message; both are proof of presence.
 *   - `Organisation.lastParticipantSweepAt` — when a full roster READ last
 *     succeeded. Only the sweep can write it, so only it can license the
 *     inference "never seen ⇒ not in the group".
 *
 * These cases pin the WIRING, and pin that split BOTH WAYS.
